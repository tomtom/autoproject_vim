*autoproject.txt*  Set a buffer's working directory and project settings
                Author: Thomas Link, micathom AT gmail com?subject=vim

This plugin tries to detect the current buffer's working directory upon 
creating a buffer or reading a file into a buffer. It does so by 
searching for certain files that typically define a project, like 
Makefile, setup.py etc. -- see |g:autoproject#cd#markers| for a full 
list. If no special file is found, the buffer's directory is used.

After the working directory is determined, it checks whether there is a 
file `project.vim` (see also |g:autoproject#projectrc#filenames|). If 
the file exists, it gets loaded. This file typically sets 
project-related settings and variables, i.e., you have to use 
|:setlocal| (instead of :set) and set |b:| variables.

How to use this plugin~
- Load a file ... done
- Report wrongly detected project directories to the plugin author

There are various similar plugins around that try to determine a buffer's 
project root directory. The autoproject plugin is a mix of those and 
plugins like localvimrc (and similar plugins).
