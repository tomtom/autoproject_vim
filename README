This plugin tries to detect the current buffer's working directory upon 
creating a buffer or reading a file into a buffer. It does so by searching for 
certain files that typically define a project, like Makefile, setup.py etc. -- 
see |g:autoproject#cd#markers| for a full list. It the registers the project 
root directory in a list. If no special file is found, the buffer's directory 
is used.

After the working directory is determined, it checks whether there is a file 
`project.vim` or `.autoproject/buffer.vim` (see also 
|g:autoproject#projectrc#buffer_conig|). If the file exists, it gets loaded. This 
file typically sets project-related settings and variables, i.e., you have to 
use |:setlocal| (instead of :set) and set |b:| variables.

Features:~
- Detect a files project root directory (see |g:autoproject#cd#markers|).
- Load a project-specific vim configuration file (see 
  |g:autoproject#projectrc#buffer_conig|).
- Maintain a list of projects (i.e. project root directories). Use 
  |:Autoprojectregister| to register an arbitrary directory. Use 
  |:Autoprojectselect| to quickly open a file in a previously opened project. 
  When a project is selected this way, the file `.autoproject/global.vim` (see 
  |g:autoproject#projectrc#global_config|) is loaded if it exists.
- Maintain project-specific sessions (see |g:autoproject_enable_sessions|, 
  |:Autoprojectmksession|, and |:Autoprojectleavesession|).

How to use this plugin:~
- Load a file ... done
    - Report wrongly detected project directories to the plugin author
- Use |:Autoprojectselect| to switch to a project.
- Use |:Autoprojectmksession| to create a session for the current project. 
  Don't forget to use |:Autoprojectleavesession| to save changes to the session 
  file when you're done.

If you don't like this plugin, there are various similar plugins around that 
try to determine a buffer's project root directory. The autoproject plugin is a 
mix of those and plugins like localvimrc (and similar plugins).
